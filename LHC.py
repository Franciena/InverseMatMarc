# This file uses the pyDOE module to use the lhc function and obtain 10 random starting points for the optimisation
# procedure. Since random points between 0-1 are chosen, these points need to be scaled between the upper and lower 
# bound given.

# These upper and lower bounds can be changed as desired, by default they were chosen to be 20% above and below the 
# original material model's values used in the "Experimental" model:
#       orig_coef = [0.26056762, 0.09754981, 0.05750069]
