# This file was written to calculate the Stardard Error of Estimation error for a specific project. The order of the input files are explained
# below. The file can be used for any data if the input files are accoring to the specified format.

# // This function calculates  the Stardard Error of Estimation, takes 2 necessary inputs and 1 optional:
#   -   1. fvr = FEM data after RBF interpolation, contains all the data wanted for calculations.
#           - "fvr" must be 3D: 1 - number of increments, 2 - nodes as rows, 3 - dimensions and other data as columns
#           - "fvr" the first few columns must be the same data as the columns in "de"
#           - in this code is was coded that column 1-2/3 is the x,y,z-disp directions
#   -   2. de = EXP disp data with column 1 as x-direc, 2 as y-direction and 3rd direction optional as z-direction (one direction is also okay)
#   -   3. *args = list of increments to calculate. If args = 0 then the default is to calculate all the increments present in the data
#                       and "fvr" and "de" needs to be 3D arrays. There are 2 input options:
#           - a. only one input is given - int saying the first few increments corresponding to the int will be calculated
#           - b. 2 or more inputs = 1st input is int saying how many increments
#                                   2nd and rest optional more, are the increments to calculate
